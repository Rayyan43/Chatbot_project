# Python Customer Service Chatbot Framework

## Description

This project serves as a foundational framework for building a Python-based customer service chatbot. It provides a basic command-line interface that can understand simple commands, simulate interactions with external APIs (like a knowledge base or ticketing system), and handle basic errors. Its primary purpose is to be a starting point for developing a more advanced and feature-rich chatbot.

Current capabilities include:
- Interactive command-line interaction.
- Echoing general user input.
- Basic command parsing for simulated API calls.
- Rudimentary error handling for user input and simulated API issues.

## Current Features

-   **Interactive Command-Line Interface:** Allows users to interact with the chatbot directly from their terminal.
-   **Echo Mode:** By default, the chatbot echoes back any input it doesn't recognize as a specific command.
-   **Exit Command:** Users can type `exit` (case-insensitive) to terminate the chatbot session.
-   **Placeholder API Commands:**
    -   `search <query>`: Simulates a search query to an external knowledge base. For example, `search how to reset password`.
    -   `ticket <details>`: Simulates the creation of a support ticket. For example, `ticket summary:Login issue, description:I cannot access my account.`. (Note: The current parsing for details is basic; a more structured input might be needed for real API calls).
-   **Basic Error Handling:**
    -   Provides user-friendly messages for malformed commands (e.g., `search` without a query).
    -   Simulates and handles potential errors from API calls (e.g., "API connection failed").
    -   Includes a general exception handler for unexpected issues.

## Technology Stack

-   **Python 3:** The chatbot is written entirely in Python 3.
-   **Standard Libraries:** Uses only Python's built-in standard libraries (e.g., `random` for error simulation).

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure Python 3 is Installed:** You need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located.
3.  **Run the Chatbot:** Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
4.  **Interact:** The chatbot will initialize, and you can start typing commands or messages.

## Future Development

This framework is designed for expansion. Potential future enhancements include:

-   **Actual API Integration:** Connecting the placeholder functions to real customer service APIs (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce, custom knowledge bases).
-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Integrating NLP libraries (like SpaCy, NLTK, or cloud-based services like Dialogflow, Amazon Lex) to understand user intent more naturally, instead of relying on exact command matching.
-   **Conversation History:** Storing and recalling previous parts of the conversation to provide context.
-   **User Authentication:** Implementing secure user authentication before accessing sensitive information or creating tickets.
-   **Advanced State Management:** Managing more complex conversational flows and user states.
-   **Logging and Analytics:** Implementing more robust logging for monitoring and analytics.
-   **Configuration Management:** Allowing API keys, URLs, and other settings to be configured externally (e.g., via environment variables or configuration files).
-   **Testing:** Adding a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
