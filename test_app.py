    # Comment on APIError testing:
    # Testing the APIError path for search_knowledge_base and create_ticket deterministically
    # is challenging with the current random error simulation.
    # To properly test this, we would typically use:
    # 1. Mocking: Replace `random.random` or the API call functions themselves with mocks
    #    that can be controlled to simulate an error.
    # 2. Dependency Injection: Pass the random number generator or error-prone components
    #    as arguments to the functions, allowing a controlled version to be injected during tests.
    # These approaches are beyond the scope of this basic testing setup.
